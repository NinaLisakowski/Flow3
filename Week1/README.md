## The questions from “Lifting State” :
- What is meant by the react term “Lifting State Up”?
  * Sharing state is done by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it.
- Where do you lift it up to?
  * The closest ancestor, so that is can be used down into a sibling. 
- Which way does React recommend data to flow: From sibling to sibling, from bottom to top or from top to bottom?
  * From top to bottom.
- Lifting state up, involves a great deal of boilerplate code, what’s the benefit we get from doing “things” like this?
  * The code can be reused with small changes, this makes it easier to find bugs, because the “original” code works.
