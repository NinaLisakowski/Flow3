- There was no assignment for this day.

## The questions from “Exercises Security” :

- Did this logout involve the server?
  - No it did not. It was removed from the storage in the browser. The login uses the server, bacause the console shows the fetching of GET and POST.
- Is the token (if kept somewhere, still valid?)
  - The token is removed from the locale storage, and is therefore still valid. It is valid for half an hour after it is created. It can be testet through postman.
